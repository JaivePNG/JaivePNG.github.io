            <h1> The Story So Far </h1>
            <p>
            I havent watched the 'Fireside Chat' video. I tried too. It took over an hour to get only 4 minutes of video so I had to make a choice to save the data for the Waffle and the Virtual Machine. I lost connectivity after that. I will watch the video later when I get to the place where i can get faster connectivity on the weekend. I hope you all can give me a pass on this one video. I promise to watch this Saturday and update this post. ( I also havent watched any of the other videos, opting to just google the links and find info that I can read instead)
             <p>
              Based on my experience so far, I am enjoying it immensily. I go to sleep tired yet fully awake (weird) because of terminal and VM and Waffle and Slack. Speaking of Slack, I am loving it and the conversations. I am learning alot from everyone else as well. 
              <p>
              I want to contribute more to conversations and help out where I can, but i feel i am bit behind everyone else, so as I pick up speed, I promise to improve my constructive participation.
              <p>
              I am having some issues understanding the questions, i believe its a cultural thing and the more I progress, the less mistakes I will make. However I do spend alot of time going over what I do as well, and most times the mistakes are my own from missing steps.
              <p>
              The culture at EDA Hihi is awesome. I am really looking forward to bootcamp so I need to get my visa sorted out.
              <p>
              EDA has been everything I thought it would be. Its engaging, difficult and has a great community vibe about it. I am pretty excited, though at the sametime, I am extremely nervous as well.
