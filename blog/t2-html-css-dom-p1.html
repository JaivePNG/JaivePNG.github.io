            <h3 id ="dom1"> What is HTML </h3>
              HTML is a language that web developers use to describe web pages of a website. Its like how a mechanic can describe different cars. The different elements that make a up a car, for example its wheels, or its engine or its brakes or seats all make up the car, yet have different properties. This is the same for the HTML that is in a website, it can be organised to have different properties, which are classified as HTML tags ( for example, headlines and sub-headlines etc are different properties)
    <p>
        </section>      
      <section class = definitions>
        <h3 id ="dom2"> What is CSS </h3>
            CSS is the cascading style sheet. CSS basically means how your html is styled - whether it has blue letters or red letters etc. The CSS of a website is like the instructions in a factory of how a car will be made, what colors will the be off, what will the tires look like, what kind of engine will be in all the cars. The CSS helps the web developer work faster at developing the website as the styles can be repeated through the website easily. And just like in a company that has factory all over the world, the CSS helps web browsers see the appropriae designed website or page, no matter what type of web browser the audience is using.

      <h3 id ="dom3"> What is DOM </h3>
          The Document Object Model or DOM of a website is the structure of the website. If the car factory had something similiar to the DOM, this would be a document that showed the structure and sub-structures of the car. This would allow the car makers to understand the important components of the car, how they worked and how they influenced each other and how all of this comes together to make a car run, and also at what specifications. A racing cars specification is different from a sedans, even though they are both cars. This is the same as the website DOM.
          More specifically, the DOM builds a way for software such our browser, to interpret the code, so that we understand it. The DOM is very effective at its job, thats why the internet works.

        <h3 id ="dom4"> What Is Boxify Design </h3>
          "Boxify Design" - is the process when you design a website, you draw (rectangular) boxes around the elements of the website, whether you do it free hand or with a sofware like photoshop. Boxify design is a good design process that helps us work on the bigger framework of the website, and then progress further into design, fixing little details as we go.
      <p>

  <section class = definitions>
     <h3 id ="dom5"> What Is Box Model </h3>
        Everything in a website is a 'Box'. All boxes consists of the concepts or properties, which are > Margins, Borders, Padding and Content. This Box Model helps the designer make the website work in a way that is visually appealing, and easier to interpret. If not, than most websites would be a mess.
