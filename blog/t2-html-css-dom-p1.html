            <h3 id ="dom1"> What is HTML </h3>
              HTML is a language that web developers use to describe web pages of a website. Its like how a mechanic can describe different cars. The different elements that make a up a car, for example its wheels, or its engine or its brakes or seats all make up the car, yet have different properties. This is the same for the HTML that is in a website, it can be organised to have different properties, which are classified as HTML tags ( for example, headlines and sub-headlines etc are different properties)

        <h3 id ="dom2"> What is CSS </h3>
            CSS is the cascading style sheet. The CSS of a website is like the instructions in a factory of how a car will be made, what colors will the be off, what will the tires look like, what kind of engine will be in all the cars. The CSS helps the web developer work faster at developing the website as the styles can be repeated through the website easily. And just like in a company that has factory all over the world, the CSS helps web browsers see the appropriae designed website or page, no matter what type of web browser the audience is using.

      <h3 id ="dom3"> What is DOM </h3>
          The Document Object Model or DOM of a website is the structure of the website. If the car factory had something similiar to the DOM, this would be a document that showed the structure and sub-structures of the car. This would allow the car makers to understand the important components of the car, how they worked and how they influenced each other and how all of this comes together to make a car run, and also at what specifications. A racing cars specification is different from a sedans, even though they are both cars. This is the same as the website DOM.
