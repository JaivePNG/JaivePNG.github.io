            <p>
            I tested Timebox and Pomodoro, as well going micro on tasks ( 2 minutes). I use these techniques from now on.

            I found the fogg method interesting and I will use it to increase my knowledge of where the keys when I am typing so I'll get better at touch typing.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pomodoro has worked for me. Meditation also works as I sort of do a bit of it at after each session here.
            I will experiment on meditation more, and the Fogg method.

            I also found the research on growth mentallity interesting and re-assuring as well :).
