            <h1> Time Methods </h1>
            <p>
            I tested <b>Timebox</b> and <b>Pomodoro</b>, as well going micro on tasks ( 2 minutes). I use these techniques from now on.
            <p>
            I found the fogg method interesting and I will use it to increase my knowledge of where the keys when I am typing so I'll get better at touch typing.
            <p>
            <b>Pomodoro</b> has worked for me. <b>Meditation</b> I am keen to get better at.
            I will experiment on meditation more, and the <b>Fogg method</b> 
            <p>
            I also found the research on <b>Growth mindset</b> interesting and re-assuring as well :).
