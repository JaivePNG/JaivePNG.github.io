            <h3 id ="dom1"> What is GRID BASED DESIGN </h3>
              Grid Based Design is a designed method based on our human eye patterns of reading a book, newspaper and websites. We read across and then down and across and then down - repeat. Our eyes follow a natural grid like pattern. This natural process has been adopted into design, creating the method of Grid Based Design for web development.
              <p>
              When you design your website, draw your website up as a grid with columns and rows. This helps you design a website more effectivily and add changes to its styles so that the website can also be responsive.

        <h3 id ="dom2"> Why Responsive Design? </h3>
            All the hype about responsive design is because of the prolific adoption of mobile phones and tablets around the world, and the increase in people using these devices instead of the traditional size computer monitor to interact with websites.
            <p>
            There are many different devices that people can visit your website on. Therefore your website design must consider the experience of the user when they visiting your website via mobiles phones, tablets, PC etc. Responsive design is the process of making your website automatically responsive to the resolution of these devices by writing into its styles a command that triggers certain responses when a certain screen resolution is detected. For example, when viewed on a PC, your website shows images, but when it is viewed on a mobile phone, there are no images just text, not because the device is doing, but because of the code you implemented on the website that reacts to the change in the screen size.

      <h3 id ="dom3"> Semantic Structure </h3>
          Humans need to read the information on your website so you use Semantic Tags such as Header, Image and Form tags to provide good structure for the website visitor.

        <h3 id ="dom4"> Negative Space </h3>
          This is the effective use of space in a website, so that the website is easier to read and not cluttered and messy.
      <p>

     <h3 id ="dom5"> I find Media Queries interesting </h3>
     I can make a website responsive by adding a Media Query in the CSS to with specifications within the parenthesis (max-width etc) that makes the website CSS style applicable only when the conditions (screen size etc) are met.
