              <b>Mindfulness & Self Awareness</b>
              <p>
                In my own words, the practice of bringing attention to our present moment (our present state) is the best way to explain the depth in relationship between increase mindfulness and self awareness.
              <p>    
                Mindfulness is  our ability to increase our focus on our present mindset, to understand and see how emotions and thoughts rise and ebb in our minds and our body.
              <p>
                Self awareness is to understand the state that we are in, to understand the physiological changes that betray our true state before we aware of it.
              <p>
                Like right now, I am sitting at a hotel, 10 miles from where I live, determined to get this sprint done, and ,my shoulders hurt. my thoughts wander, I want to go to sleep. These are stress indicators :)
              <p> 
              <b>Body Scan</b>
              <p>
              One of the biggest insights after doing the body scan, is that my hands contain a lot of stress, or negative energy etc. Since then, I have learnt to keep them open when I feel stress or if I noticed that they are tense, its a good time to start the body scan exercise to relax my whole self as much as possible.
              <p>
              <b>My Emotions Are Not Me</b>
              <p>
              I live in a society where we are heavily invested emotionally, sometimes and often times, negatively in the daily grind of our lives and interactions with each other. Many times, many of my decisions are often based or influenced by how I feel, and less by what my long term goals are or what my true motivations are. 
              <p>
              Letting my emotions define me, means that I am less in control of the how the future I want for myself becomes. These meditation and awareness exercises as part of the Eda program have helped me gain some control of my decision making process, just because I get upset doesnt mean I let it influence how I can proactively address a situation or circumstance as it arises. 
              <p>
              Javascript is hard, there is no doubt about it. Loops are both easy and maddening at the same time. This is a major investment for me. One of the hardest things was explaining to people in my life, who were upset that I was overseas studying when I should be back home 'helping' them. Maybe I got upset at the start, but my emotions are not me, and neither are their emotions 'me'. I have the power to choose the condition I am in, its hard, but I am getting better at it. 

              <p>
