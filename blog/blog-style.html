            <h1> Time Methods </h1>
            <p>
            I tested <b>Timebox</b> and <b>Pomodoro</b>, as well going micro on tasks ( 2 minutes). I use these techniques from now on.
            <p>
            I found the fogg method interesting and I will use it to increase my knowledge of where the keys when I am typing so I'll get better at touch typing.
            <p>
            <b>Pomodoro</b> has worked for me. <b>Meditation</b> I am keen to get better at.
            I will experiment on meditation more, and the <b>Fogg method</b> 
            <p>
            I also found the research on <b>Growth mindset</b> interesting and re-assuring as well :).
            <p>
            I was just pouring over all the material in this task. It has been immensily mind expanding for me. I found the material on habits was what I needed to improve my skills. Improvement of my skills is important to improve my behavour and finally on my output. For example, I need to develop a trigger to start engaging on the slack channel. So it might be that after I finish a task, I should post a helpful link or research someones material posted on Slack.
            To improve my coding, I should show up everyday at the Eda center and just be in the environment with everyone else.
            I have to become the agent of change. 
            <p>
            The article on Creative Sources on Quora was mind blowing/paradign shifting - especially when explaining where "flow" was generated. The author states and I quote "The way to achieve this is to be 100x more resourceful, not forceful" ie we can engineer our environment, decide our behaviour and triggers - choose whether we will be the agent or the customer ie restaurent vs kitchen - when we make these choices and then make these choices systematic, the flow that we seek is closer than we think.
