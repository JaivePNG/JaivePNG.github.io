                <h1> .map, .reduce and filter explained by Jaive </h1>
                <p>
                <b>array.prototype.map</b>
                <p>
                  The map method runs through an initial element, and calls a function on each element of that array and creates a new array with result of each call pushed in as new elements of that new array
                <p>
                  array.prototype.filter
                <p>
                  The filter method goes through elements of an array and return these elements only if they meet the condition as set in the function. Basically it runs a test on each element and only calkls back elements that pass this test.
                <p>
                  array.prototype.reduce
                <p>
                  Sometimes the videos are easier to understand then reading text. This one was the hardest to understand till i watched some videos.
                  The. reduces method runs through each element of an array and runs a call back function on values in these array, however, the call back is the cumulative value of the previous call back etc and so on until the value it returns is the cumulative value of all the callbacks.
                <p>
                  These methods reduce the amount of code, especially in reducing the dependence on for loops, and return results quicker.
                <p>
                  <h1>Story to A Friend</h>
                <p>
                  I was stuck in solving a problem to do with a game as per the course. My code looked right, felt right, but it wasn't working.
                  So i started to talk to these Japanese dolls I have on my desk, explaining the problem. Then I did some psuedocode while I talked to them, and then I looked back at my codeâ€¦and realized I just had to clean it up and correct some typos.
                  Sure enough, it worked.
                <p>
                  The biggest lesson I learnt is that you need to talk the problem out a bit, even with inanimate objects, as it frees your mind from obsessively trying to solve the problem and being blind to the to the obvious. After just talking to these dolls, the answer seemed so obvious.
                <p>
                  <h1>Pseudocode</h1>
                  This is a work in progress -- sometimes my pseudocode helps me solve a task, sometimes it leads me down a rabbit hole. I feel practice will make me better at it.
                <p>
                  <h1>Trying Something</h1>
                  Many times trying something has been a saviour one way or another. Just seeing something work on the first go is awesome!! I try to understand a method/fucntion before I try it, so its often a good learning experience.
                <p>
                  <h1>Rubber Ducky</h1>
                <p>
                  My favorite method. I just talk to anything when I am stuck, sometimes its just for motivation or helps me relax. However 90 percent of the time its for the code work.
                <p>
                  <h1>Reading Error Messages</h1>
                <p>
                  Reading the error messages helps me a lot with cleaning up my javascript and code. I use this almost every time.
                <p>
                <h1>Console.log</h1>
                <p>
                  The console.log is really my number one friend. I run small snippets of code with the javascript tester and the in the console.log as well. Its a tedious process sometimes. I wish there was a way to automatically record all the console.logs I run sometimes, or if I had a massive one set up somehow. My computer screen is too small.
                <p>
                  <h1>Googling</h1>
                <p>
                  I spend more time on google then on the actual tasks. I have become better at using google when searching for solutions. However, sometimes if I am not careful and my psuedocde is wrong, I can go off searching for wrong answers.
                <p>
                <h1>  Asking peers for help</h1>
                <p>
                  This is something I have constantly failed at. I want to. I don't know how to phrase my questions and sometimes I post and then I don't understand what I have done, so I google and realize another answer somehow. I am struggling with this. ("ill be honest).
                <p>
                <h1>Asking coaches for help.</h1>
                  From time to time, I reach out to the coaches for help. I don't know. Maybe not enough.
                <p>
                <h1>Improving your process through reflection</h1>
                  Javascript is hard. My room is covered in Javascript stuff. I dream in Javascript. Its only matter of time. I know that massive success requires massive effort. Maybe I am scared of becoming good at this -- maybe I want to still be average in PNG and not do something great with my life to create opportunity and move us away from this horrible conflict focused mindset that dominates our culture. Maybe I want the violence and the problems not to change, maybe its easier to avoid doing the hard mental yards to totally adopt the coders mindset.

                  I like Javascript. I strangely enjoy the challenge. After I do this, I will be the only one in this whole country that can do this -- and that scares me. On a subconscious level, its probably the only reason why I am going super slow at this.

                  Not today. Not tonight. Not anymore.
                  Just do it.
