          <h2> DESIGN TO WEB BLOG</h2>
          </header>
              <p> 
                  There are so many different screen sizes to view websites these days.
                  These different devices and their corresponding screen sizes effect how the same website is interacted with on these different devices.
                  For example, how scroll bars work, how images are viewed, how buttons and tabs are interacted in.
                  If a website is not responsive, it may look good on a large screen, such as desktop, but a total mess on a tablet.
                  This is why a website must be responsive.
              </p>

              <h2>Why is Mobile First Design Important.</h2>

              <p>
                  Its important because alot of websites and applications these days are viewed on mobile phones. Developing your website for mobile phones first, allows you to scale up the user experience for larger screens, instead of the other way around. It just makes it easier. You also can make effective decisions on content and other features. You can also prioritise what is the most important content of your website, so that it appears on top in your design.
              </p>

              <h2>What Are Responsive Frameworks</h2>

              <p>
                  Frameworks are website pre-built website structures that utilise the Grid Framework method to assist developers build 12 - 16 columns and so forth websites.
                  It frees the designer to concentrate on placing elements and content of the the websites, it also takes care of the website being viewed on different browsers, and styling and typography are standardised.
              </p>
              <p>
                  However, sometimes you are stuck with some of the structure/code of the framework and may not suit your needs, so you would have to bit more work on the structure of your site.
