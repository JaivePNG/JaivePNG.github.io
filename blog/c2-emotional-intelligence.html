    <h3 id ="dom1"> Happier People Achieve More </h3>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor your own feelings and emotions as well as reactions to these sensations and make conscious decision on how you will act towards these sensations. Your actions are now based on more self awareness,  empathy, values, judgements, principles and thought.
        People who demonstrate high emtional intelligence have stellar work performance, oustanding leadership especially at/in times of crisis or challenge, and the ability to create conditions for happiness.

    <h3 id ="dom2"> How to develop emotional intelligence </h3>
        Emotional intelligence can be developed. One way is the practice of mindful attentiveness, ie paying attention to the act of paying attention, which frees us from making judgements of where our focus should be. This creates self awareness. Another method is to visualise how our body reacts to certain emotions and events, and then re-imagine how we will act in the future to this stimuli. This practice creates the process of self-regulation when such a real scenerio happens, an important pillar of emotional intelligence.

      <h3 id ="dom3"> Two Minute Meditation </h3>
        Two minutes of mindfulness is an easy way to practice and be introduced to mindfulness, even though the author says that concentrating on breath and the process of breathing is the harder way, I found it easier as my mind kept wandering using the other method.
