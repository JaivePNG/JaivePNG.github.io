            Just another super sunny day in this super hot and humid and dry city.I swear it must be 40 degrees outside, people walking around with umbrellas and its not even raining :). My name is Jaive. I am from Papua.

            The very hot city I live in is called Port Moresby, about 7 hours in a jet from Auckland.
